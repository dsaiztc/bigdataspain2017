# BigDataSpain2017

Having a difficult time deciding which talks to go on [BigData Spain 2017](https://www.bigdataspain.org/2017/schedule)?

Download the iCalendar file [bigdataspain.ics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsaiztc/bigdataspain2017/master/bigdataspain.ics) and import it to your favorite Calendar application ([Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com), [MS Outlook](https://calendar.live.com), [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/thunderbird/), etc.)

If you want the most *up-to-date* version then you should create it by yourself, simply download the code and run the `main.py` script, that'll create a **bigdataspain.ics** file that you can import to your Calendar application.

Enjoy!
