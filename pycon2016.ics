SUMMARY:Putting python data science into production
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nData science once involved working with a large data set in relative  isolation and producing a static report to present at a quarterly  meeting. Decision makers in companies have been inspired by the types of  insights the data can offer and are asking more questions of it\, such  as what happens if I change this variable or where did this result come  from. Data scientist regularly now present their analysis not in reports  but in web apps or behind APIs that allow this kind of interrogation. We have been building data science solutions for 10 years and have  learnt many lessons along the way. In this talk we will run through how  to build performant\, scalable and validated data science web apps\, using  python.\n\nSpeakers:\nBrian  O'Mullane - Head of Software Development - cremeglobal.com

SUMMARY:All Kinds of Everything - Human Input Devices in Python
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nInputs is a brand new module published in 2016 but it is already  gaining some traction. The inputs module provides cross-platform Python  support for keyboards\, mice\, gamepads\, touch screens\, wiimotes\, buttons\,  switches and pretty much any other input device you might want to use.  Currently supported platforms are the Raspberry Pi\, Linux\, Windows and  the Apple Mac. The talk is suitable for everyone. The inputs module is very high  level and suitable for complete beginners to programming\, I will also  explain very briefly for more advanced developers how to support a new  class of device\, but not in a boring way.In a light-hearted fashion\, I will demonstrate how to use the inputsmodule  and will demonstrate some embedded/Internet of Things use cases\, a  digital signage use case and some more comical\, imaginative and  entertaining applications of the module.https://pypi.python.org/pypi/inputs\n\nSpeakers:\nZeth Green - Lead Developer - infomachine.uk

SUMMARY:Sharing knowledge in the Python ecosystem
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nData Scientists (or researchers) often do many early-stage prototyping and run many experiments before finding the optimal solution for the problem they are trying to solve. However\, sometimes\, a lot of the knowledge gained in the process stays with the person. In this proposed talk\, I would like to introduce how to produce\, share and ensure the reproducibility of experiments using jupyter notebooks and github. This is a series of lessons Iearned while being a research student (where open-sourcing the code and data used to generate papers is very important) and more recently\, working in a new team in Zalando\, where we have experimented with different ways to share and review the data science tasks\, as well as the knowledge generated from those tasks.\n\nSpeakers:\n

SUMMARY:Python for Text Analysis Kaggle Competition
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nUsing the recent Home Depot Search Relevance Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-depot-product-search-relevance)  as an example\, this talk will give a general overview of a predictive  analytics project in python\, specifically focusing on text analytics. This talk will first give an introduction to Kaggle and this  competition in particular. To give an introduction to predictive  analytics\, I will then show how to start designing "features" which  describe the similarity of two samples of text. Using a very simple  feature\, the number of overlapping words\, we can build our first simple  predictive model. Building on this base\, we'll then explore more  advanced text mining techniques\, such as term frequency matrices\,  TF-IDF\, Latent Semantic Analysis\, and word2vec. Finally\, we can see how  the final random forest model performs and what the most important  features were.I've delivered this presentation in 30 minutes at a work event  already. I can tweak the talk to focus less on the introduction to  predictive analytics and more on the text analytics methods if that  would be a better fit for the audience.\n\nSpeakers:\nJohn  Savage - Data Engineer - Deutsche Bank

SUMMARY:Try\, try\, and try again
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nWriting code in Python is easier than most other   programming languages. So much so\, in fact\, that it's easy to quickly  knock-up something  to solve a problem\, especially if your code is  ultimately "throw-away".  As a language\, Python's  great at not getting in your way: you write  your code\, it  runs\, then  you move onto something else. But\, how easy is it to to  write  robust code  in Python? What if your code has to hang around for a  long time? What  if you need to write code which not only runs but also  has to handle  problems should they occur? In this talk\, Paul attempts  to answer these questions by presenting  some working  code\, which he then dissects to highlight some of the  things that can go wrong\,  before describing how it's possible to handle  and survive the identified  problems (should they occur).\n\nSpeakers:\nPaul Barry - Lecturer - Institute of Technology\, Carlow

SUMMARY:Overview of Python Web Development\, from Searching to Deployment.
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nThis talk is about helping people new to development & Python to connect the dots between googling python web development and reaching deployment. When entering the world of development there is a huge learning curve. Its not just about understanding python syntax and writing a function. How does everything fit together? This talk will attempt to introduce the budding developer to the options available and why you may choose one over another.I will run through the following topics: The major python web frameworks that exist. We will examine the pros and cons of the main players.Python itself\, Apis vs Services\, what goes where?How to build restfully and the importance of adhering to correct http protocols. How does javascript know what to do?The merits of testing and running through the different testing libraries that are available.Brief intro to Github and pointing to resources to help learn how to commit.Highlighting any gotchasDeployment tools.Hosting\, where to go?How to google for relevant answers.Python community for answers. (globally and local)Hopefully those that attending will have a greater understanding of the whole development system so they will know what to research for each step and where to find answers.\n\nSpeakers:\nAndrea Fagan - Software Engineer - Bank of America

SUMMARY:The power of SQLAlchemy
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nThe power of SQLAlchemy Object-relational mappers (ORM) have somewhat of a bad reputation. SQLAlchemy is not just an ORM\, but gives you an entire toolkit to aid you in working with any SQL relational database.In this talk I will give an introduction and deep dive into the 2 main sections of the library\, the expression language and the ORM. And outline some of the more powerful features available at your fingertips.I have used SQLAlchemy extensively for over 3 years now. Creating a full domain model using it's declarative mappings. Constructing optimized queries and custom SQL statements and built a self-optimizing domain specific language (DSL) for a fully-fledged REST API.I hope to impart some of the tips\, tricks and ways of working that I have gained over this time.\n\nSpeakers:\nDavid Mcilwee - Team lead\, Scrum Master and Senior Software Engineer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch

SUMMARY:Natural Language Processing with Python
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nThis tutorial will introduce the audience to the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) using a hands-on approach. Analysing and truly understanding natural language\n is a difficult task\, but Python doesn't fall short in terms of making \nthis topic approachable\, thanks to its rich ecosystem and active \ncommunity.Firstly we'll provide an overview on NLP using NLTK\, the Natural Language Toolkit\, one of the most popular Python library for NLP. We'll discuss some of the most important text processing steps and how they impact the quality of our final application.We'll then move on to some notions of word frequency analysis\, like TF \nand IDF. All these concepts are going to be applied in the context of a \ntext classification system. Using scikit-learn\, we'll understand how to build a classifier\, and how to use\n it to categorise documents according to pre-defined labels. We'll \nbriefly discuss how to assess the quality of our model\, and how we can \ntune it to achieve better predictions.There are no particular requirements to attend this tutorial\, so Python \nbeginners are welcome. Some prior basic notions of machine learning can \nbe beneficial\, but the theoretical aspects are kept to the bare minimum:\n the aim of this tutorial is to be practical and approachable. Attendees\n are encouraged to bring their own laptop with Python 3\, NLTK and \nscikit-learn pre-installed (instructions for pip/virtualenv will be \nprovided\, but please feel free to set up the environment in advance).\n\nSpeakers:\nMarco Bonzanini  - Data Scientist - Bonzanini Consulting Ltd

SUMMARY:Gilectomy
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nCPythons Global Interpreter Lock\, or GIL\, was added in 1992. It was an excellent design decision. But 24 years is a long timetoday it prevents Python from capitalizing on multiple CPUs. Many people want us to remove the GIL.It turns out\, removing the GIL isnt actually that hard. In fact\, I already removed it\, in my experimental gilectomy branch. But the GIL is one reason CPython is so fast! The gilectomy makes CPython shockingly slow.This talk will discuss the history of the GIL\, how the GIL helps make CPython fast\, how the gilectomy removed the GIL\, and some ways we might be able to make the gilectomy version fast enough to be useful.\n\nSpeakers:\nLarry Hastings - Release Manager for Python 3.4 and 3.5 - python.org

SUMMARY:A Gentle Introduction to Neural Networks (with Python)
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nThere is huge interest in neural networks right now - they are the  core of deep learning which recently has been in the news (self driving  cars\, health data Google beating world Go champion)\, and a key tool for  data scientists\, skills sought by more and more organisations to remain  competitive. They're also fun to play with!This talk presents a very gentle introduction to neural networks\, and how to make your own with Python.It is deliberately designed to be accessible to everyone - including  anyone with no expertise in mathematics\, computer science or Python.After this session you should have an intuitive understanding of what  neural networks are and how they work\, how they were inspired by  nature\, and what you can do with them. If you can program in Python  (beginner to intermediate)\, you will see how you could make your own  with Python and numpy.Part 1 - Ideas: - the search for AI\, hard problems for computers easy  fro humans - learning from examples (simple classifier) - biologically  inspired neurons and networks - training a neural network - the back  propagation breakthrough - matrix ways of working (good for computers)Part 2 - Python: - Python is easy\, and everywhere - Python notebooks -  the MNIST data set - a very simple neural network class - focus on  concise and efficient matrix calculations with bumpy - 97.5% accuracy  recognising handwritten numbers - with just a few lines of code!Part 3 - Live demo! .. and Q&A\;\n\nSpeakers:\nTariq Rashid

SUMMARY:How Data Science fits in the Balanced Team
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nThe goal of a Balanced Team is to share ownership and responsibility  for the success of a project between team members. Each team member has  specific obligations to the team and a specific area of authority. Until  recently\, designers\, product managers and developers were the usual  team members considered. In this talk I will explore how data scientists  can function in a balanced team and discuss my experience working as a  data scientist on balanced teams at Pivotal Labs with our global  clients. I will consider what obligations and authority a data scientist  can provide as part of a balanced team and how this situation differs  from the usual jack-of-all-trades type data science work. I will outline specific examples where data science can help user  centric design and product management\, and where the practices of  lean-startup and agile development can help accelerate analysis and data  science. Based on my experience building data science driven products  with a global bank and European car manufacturers\, I will outline what  we tried\, what worked and most importantly what didnt.If you are a data scientist or need to work with one\, this talk will  equip you to understand how data science can be an integral part of a  balanced team.\n\nSpeakers:\nIan Huston - Principal Data Scientist - Pivotal

SUMMARY:Lessons Learned Open Sourcing Codespeed
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nOpen Sourcing a Python project can teach you lessons in so diverse  fields as Software Engineering\, Project Management\, Marketing\, Community  Management and more. Looking back at the past 7 years\, Codespeed\, my first Open Source  project\, has been a niche but very successful project by many metrics.  It is or has been in use by well-known projects and organizations like  the PSF\, PyPy\, Twisted\, RubySpec\, Julia (lang)\, companies like AMD\,  Dropbox and many others\, and to this date there is no clear alternative.  And yet its codebase has become a mess and active development grounded  to a halt for a spell of two or three years.What lessons can we learn from that story? This talk will highlight  some aspects that went horribly wrong\, as well as explain some concepts  in the original design that proved key for the project's success.\n\nSpeakers:\nMiquel Torres - Lead Developer - Scurri

SUMMARY:Detection of Duplicate Records in Large-scale Multi-tenant Platforms
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nZalando's quest to create an open multi-tenant fashion platform has  its challenges. One of these is the detection of duplicate product  records within the platform\, where different tenants input the same  product using different product descriptions. Commonly referred to as  theRecord Linkageproblem in Machine Learning\, the task is to  group together similar product records under a single canonical  identifier\, which is useful for business intelligence purposes and for  product search etc. The kernel of the solution is the computation of an  ~O(n**2) all-pairs similarity join\, where the runtime explodes  quadratically with an increase in input. At Zalando's Fashion Insight Centre in Dublin we are looking at  solutions to this problem that work at scale (i.e.\, more than one  million products). For our particular problem\, which involves  Categorical Data (cosine similarity will not work here)\, we employ a  data-driven similarity measure and approximate the similarity join using  a two-step approach. In this talk we introduce the standard approaches  to the problem and illustrate our work-to-date using Python.\n\nSpeakers:\nPaul  O'Grady - Data Scientist - Zalando

SUMMARY:The Evolution of Containerised Testing at Demonware
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nAs the feedback loop between developers and customers continues to shrink\, the ability to deliver features and fixes in near real-time becomes more crucial.  Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines can enable teams to deliver code quickly but optimisation of the Build\, Test and Deploy stages can be the difference between a 10 minute deployment and a 5 hour deployment.At Demonware we are using Docker to optimise the Test Stage of our CD pipelines.  Containerised testing has helped us reduce test execution time\, make tests more portable\, better utilize our test infrastructure and deliver game services to our customers faster.This talk will cover some of the challenges we faced along the way and the various approaches we used to containerise our tests.\n\nSpeakers:\nThomas Shaw - Build Engineer - Demonware\; James Heslin - Django developer - Demonware

SUMMARY:Natural Language Processing using Python tools
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nIn this talk I would like to focus more on how language processing is made easier using python tool kits. How can we set up pipeline starting from scratch to the specific solution using Python tools. I have been using python from last 5-6 years and my main area of research is language processing and information retrieval. I have used python tools previously on various projects and problems related to Sentiment analysis\, Text processing\, Summarization \, Classification etc. For details you can check out my profilehttp://computing.dcu.ie/~parora/.I would like to talk about main 2 aspects: 1) Based Raw Text processing: using NLTK toolkit and other plugins2) Deep learning: using Gensim toolkitDepending on the time availability I would like to have some hands-on experience or have some live coding to make the talk interactive.During my PhD and collaborative projects with researchers and industries I have discovered sometime starting from scratch seems quite complicated and can take lots of time and resources\, but how can we speed up that process and focus on the main innovative solution is the main key resources\, which I would like to address and discuss.\n\nSpeakers:\nPiyush  Arora - PhD Student - ADAPT\, Dublin City University

SUMMARY:Rethinking package management
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nPackaging is a hard problem. Still every language/distribution tries  to invent packaging on their own. This leaves us (developers /  sysadmins) with a big number of tools that we need to master in order to  do our job. We will look at how Nix[1] and NixOS[2] can be used in  today's software development processes and which are the benefits and  drawbacks you might face. In this talk we will look into how Nix can be used to solve some  problems we face when developing with python and how it might just be  the right tool for your next project.[1] Nix is a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix  systems that makes package management reliable and reproducible. It  provides atomic upgrades and rollbacks\, side-by-side installation of  multiple versions of a package\, multi-user package management and easy  setup of build environments.[2] NixOS is a Linux distribution built on top of the Nix package  manager\, it is completely declarative\, makes upgrading systems reliable\,  and has many other advantages.\n\nSpeakers:\nRok Garbas

SUMMARY:Introduction to Image classification in Python: from API calls to Neural Networks
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nIn a world full of user generated media content\, automated image and  video processing plays a prominent role\, both in social media apps  (face\, object\, and place detection)\, and in local applications that  automatically sort media collections\, among other uses. In the last few years\, a number of startups such as Clarifai and  Indico\, and much bigger players such as Google and Microsoft\, have  launched their own 'machine learning as a service' offerings\, including  'vision' products that can recognise objects present in image and video  footage and automatically tag them\, provide optical character  recognition (OCR) services\, and even not safe for work (NSFW)  classifiers that can be used to omit content from internal networks.This talk will focus on 'food' recognition within images\, and will  walk through the basics of how to get started with image classification\,  from using APIs and SDKs for some of the commercial (but free)  offerings available\, to trying and recreate those services locally\,  first by walking through and example of the 'bag of features' technique\,  using a mix of supervised and unsupervised methods in scikit-learn and  OpenCV\, and secondly showing examples based on 'transfer learning'\, a  'deep learning' technique to reuse pre-trained convolutional neural  networks to customise classification from smaller training datasets.\n\nSpeakers:\nJose Dominguez  - PhD student and software contractor (freelance) - Maynooth University\, Insight Centre for Data Analytics

SUMMARY:Part of Speech Tagging: Who's winning.
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nUp until quite recently the main go to part-of-speech tagger (POS) for use in Python was the NLTK Tagger using the default Penn Treebank tagger. Another popular option was from the Stanford Log-Linear Part-Of-Speech Tagger from Stanford CoreNLP. In May 2016 Google open sourced SyntaxNet with the humorously named English parser Parsey McParseFace. Another commercial companySpacy.ioalso provides an open source parser.The development of Part-Of-Speech tagging continues in academia\, but most are not at the stage where they can be easily used outside of research. How do these taggers differ? This talk will give an overview of part-of-speech tagging from a practical implementation/use-case point of view.What is part-of-speech taggingReal life performance on datasetsHow you might use POS in a projectCompare and contrast the above mentioned taggers for performance.\n\nSpeakers:\nBrian Carter  - Data Scientist - IBM

SUMMARY:Deep learning with Keras
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nIt has always been our dream to create machines that can think. In  the early phase of artificial intelligence\, we solved the problems that  could have been described by a list of formal and mathematical rules.  The main motivation was solving the tasks that are trivial for people to  perform but difficult to describe formally\, for example recognizing  objects in images or spoken words. Neural networks have been one  predominant area of research in artificial intelligence that stayed in  limelight over the past five decades or so. However\, one major boost in  this domain happened around 2010 when the computers got much faster and  data sets got much bigger. The existing algorithms with some critical  tweaks and improvements became much more efficient and won several  challenges in computer vision\, speech recognition\, and natural language  processing. In this talk\, I would briefly describe how neural networks works and  then move towards state-of-the-art approaches of deep learning. I would  describe in detail how to build deep learning models and its training  procedures using the deep learning library "Keras" that removes all of  the complexity\, leaving you an API containing only what you need to know  to efficiently develop and evaluate neural network models. This talk  aims to present two use cases (facial recognition and sequence  prediction) that uses Keras for model building and evaluation.\n\nSpeakers:\nShubhabrata  Roy - Senior Research Engineer/ Data Scientist - HERE

SUMMARY: Type Hints for Static and Runtime Type Checking
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nThe main objective of this talk is introducing type hints and the new "typing" module that appeared in Python 3.5\, along with the static analysis tools that support them. As a part of this talk\, we will also discuss how to build a runtime type checker on top of the type hints mechanics.Syllabus:- Function annotations- Brief introduction to mypy- Type hints\, typing module- Runtime type checking\n\nSpeakers:\nIvan Smirnov - Quantitative Researcher - SIG
